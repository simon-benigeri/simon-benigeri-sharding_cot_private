To determine how much Aaron's membership fee will be in the sixth year, we start with the information given: he pays $80 in the first year, and the fee increases by $10 each subsequent year.
First, let's calculate the fee for the second year. Since the fee increases by $10 from the first year, we have: Year 2: $80 + $10 = $90.
Next, we calculate the fee for the third year. Again, we add $10 to the fee from the second year: Year 3: $90 + $10 = $100.
Now, we move on to the fourth year. We continue the pattern of adding $10: Year 4: $100 + $10 = $110.
For the fifth year, we again add $10 to the fee from the fourth year: Year 5: $110 + $10 = $120.
Finally, we calculate the fee for the sixth year by adding $10 to the fee from the fifth year: Year 6: $120 + $10 = $130.
Thus, the membership cost in the sixth year is $130.
