# Alternative COT 1
# Sequence: s1 → s2 → s4 → s5 → s6 → s7 → s3

To determine the length of the third generation's tails, I will start with the first generation's tail length, which is given as 16 cm.
First, I need to calculate how much longer the second generation's tails are compared to the first generation. The problem states that each generation's tails are 25% longer than the previous generation. To find 25% of 16 cm, I can use the formula: 25% of 16 cm = 0.25 * 16 cm = 4 cm.
Next, I will add this length to the first generation's tail length to find the second generation's tail length: Second generation's tail length = First generation's tail length + Increase = 16 cm + 4 cm = 20 cm.
Now that I have the second generation's tail length, I will calculate how much longer the third generation's tails are compared to the second generation. Again, I will find 25% of the second generation's tail length, which is 20 cm: 25% of 20 cm = 0.25 * 20 cm = 5 cm.
This means that the third generation's tails are 5 cm longer than the second generation's tails.
Finally, I will add this increase to the second generation's tail length to find the third generation's tail length: Third generation's tail length = Second generation's tail length + Increase = 20 cm + 5 cm = 25 cm.
This means that the second generation's tails are 4 cm longer than the first generation's tails.
