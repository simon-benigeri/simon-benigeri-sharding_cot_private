To solve the problem, I start with the total number of Legos James has, which is 500.
Next, I need to determine how many Legos he uses to build the castle. The problem states that he uses half of his collection. So, I calculate half of 500: 500 / 2 = 250.
Now, I need to find out how many Legos are left after he puts the unused ones away. Since he started with 500 Legos and used 250, the number of Legos he has left is also 250.
However, the problem mentions that he can't find 5 of the leftover pieces. This means that when he goes to put the unused Legos back in the box, he is missing 5 pieces.
Therefore, the number of Legos he actually puts away is: 250 (the unused Legos) - 5 (the missing pieces) = 245.
Thus, at the end, the number of Legos that are in the box is 245.
