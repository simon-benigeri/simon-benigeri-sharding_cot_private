# Alternative COT 1
# Sequence: s3 → s4 → s1 → s2 → s5

The problem states that for every 5 kilograms of newspapers, the family receives $1.50. They collected 20 kilograms of newspapers, so I need to find out how many sets of 5 kilograms they have: 20 kilograms ÷ 5 = 4 sets of 5 kilograms.
Now, I can calculate how much money they will receive for the newspapers. Since each set earns them $1.50, I multiply the number of sets by the amount earned per set: 4 sets × $1.50 = $6.
The problem states that for every 12 cans recycled, the family receives $0.50. The family collected a total of 144 cans. To find out how many sets of 12 cans they have, I divide the total number of cans by 12: 144 cans ÷ 12 = 12 sets of 12 cans.
Now that I know they have 12 sets, I can calculate how much money they will receive for the cans. Since each set earns them $0.50, I multiply the number of sets by the amount earned per set: 12 sets × $0.50 = $6.
Finally, to find the total amount of money the family will receive, I add the earnings from the cans and the newspapers together: $6 (from cans) + $6 (from newspapers) = $12.
