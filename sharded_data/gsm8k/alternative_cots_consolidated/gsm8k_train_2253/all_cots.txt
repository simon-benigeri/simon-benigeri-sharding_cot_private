The problem states that peaches cost $2 per pound and that Ines bought 3 pounds
To find the total cost of the peaches, I multiply the number of pounds by the cost per pound: 3 pounds × $2 per pound = $6
Now that I know Ines spent $6 on the peaches, I can calculate how much money she has left after her purchase
To find the remaining amount, I subtract the cost of the peaches from her initial amount: $20 - $6 = $14
