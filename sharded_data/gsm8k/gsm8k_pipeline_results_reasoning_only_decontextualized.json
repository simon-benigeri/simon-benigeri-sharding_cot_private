    "question": "For every 12 cans you recycle, you receive $0.50, and for every 5 kilograms of newspapers, you receive $1.50. If your family collected 144 cans and 20 kilograms of newspapers, how much money would you receive?",
    "answer": "There are 144/12 = <<144/12=12>>12 sets of 12 cans that the family collected.\nSo, the family would receive $0.50 x 12 = $<<0.50*12=6>>6 for the cans.\nThere are 20/5 = <<20/5=4>>4 sets of 5 kilograms of newspapers that the family collected.\nSo, the family would receive $1.50 x 4 = $<<1.50*4=6>>6 for the newspapers.\nTherefore, the family would receive a total of $6 + $6 = $<<6+6=12>>12.\n#### 12",
    "final_answer": "12",
    "cot": "To solve the problem, I need to calculate how much money the family receives from recycling both cans and newspapers.\n\nFirst, let's start with the cans. The problem states that for every 12 cans recycled, the family receives $0.50. The family collected a total of 144 cans. To find out how many sets of 12 cans they have, I divide the total number of cans by 12:\n\n144 cans ÷ 12 cans/set = 12 sets of 12 cans.\n\nNow that I know they have 12 sets of cans, I can calculate how much money they earn from these cans. Since each set of 12 cans earns them $0.50, I multiply the number of sets by the amount earned per set:\n\n12 sets × $0.50/set = $6.\n\nNext, I will calculate the earnings from the newspapers. The problem states that for every 5 kilograms of newspapers, the family receives $1.50. They collected 20 kilograms of newspapers. To find out how many sets of 5 kilograms they have, I divide the total kilograms by 5:\n\n20 kilograms ÷ 5 kilograms/set = 4 sets of 5 kilograms.\n\nNow, I can calculate how much money they earn from the newspapers. Since each set of 5 kilograms earns them $1.50, I multiply the number of sets by the amount earned per set:\n\n4 sets × $1.50/set = $6.\n\nFinally, I need to find the total amount of money the family receives from both the cans and the newspapers. I add the earnings from the cans and the newspapers together:\n\n$6 (from cans) + $6 (from newspapers) = $12.\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money the family would receive is $12.",

    "question": "Betty picked 16 strawberries. Matthew picked 20 more strawberries than Betty and twice as many as Natalie. They used their strawberries to make jam. One jar of jam used 7 strawberries and they sold each jar at $4. How much money were they able to make from the strawberries they picked?",
    "answer": "Matthew picked 16 + 20 = <<16+20=36>>36 strawberries.\nNatalie picked 36/2 = <<36/2=18>>18 strawberries.\nAll together, they have 16 + 36 + 18 = <<16+36+18=70>>70 strawberries.\nThey can make 70/7 = <<70/7=10>>10 jars of strawberries.\nThey earn 10 x $4 = $<<10*4=40>>40 from the strawberries they picked.\n#### 40",
    "final_answer": "40",
    "cot": "To solve the problem, I will break it down step by step, starting with the information given about how many strawberries each person picked.\n\nFirst, we know that Betty picked 16 strawberries. \n\nNext, we need to determine how many strawberries Matthew picked. The problem states that Matthew picked 20 more strawberries than Betty. Since Betty picked 16 strawberries, we can calculate Matthew's total as follows:\nMatthew's strawberries = Betty's strawberries + 20\nMatthew's strawberries = 16 + 20 = 36 strawberries.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many strawberries Natalie picked. The problem indicates that Matthew picked twice as many strawberries as Natalie. Since we have already calculated that Matthew picked 36 strawberries, we can find Natalie's total by dividing Matthew's strawberries by 2:\nNatalie's strawberries = Matthew's strawberries / 2\nNatalie's strawberries = 36 / 2 = 18 strawberries.\n\nNow that we have the number of strawberries each person picked, we can calculate the total number of strawberries they all picked together. We add the strawberries picked by Betty, Matthew, and Natalie:\nTotal strawberries = Betty's strawberries + Matthew's strawberries + Natalie's strawberries\nTotal strawberries = 16 + 36 + 18 = 70 strawberries.\n\nNext, we need to determine how many jars of jam they can make with the total strawberries they have. Each jar of jam requires 7 strawberries. To find out how many jars they can make, we divide the total number of strawberries by the number of strawberries needed for one jar:\nNumber of jars = Total strawberries / Strawberries per jar\nNumber of jars = 70 / 7 = 10 jars.\n\nFinally, we need to calculate how much money they earned from selling the jars of jam. Each jar is sold for $4. To find the total earnings, we multiply the number of jars by the price per jar:\nTotal earnings = Number of jars × Price per jar\nTotal earnings = 10 × $4 = $40.\n\nThus, the total amount of money they were able to make from the strawberries they picked is $40.",

    "cot": "To determine how much Aaron's actuary membership costs in the sixth year, we start with the information given: he pays $80 in the first year and the fee increases by $10 each subsequent year.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the membership fee for the second year. Since the fee increases by $10 from the first year, we have:\n- Year 2 fee = Year 1 fee + $10 = $80 + $10 = $90.\n\nNext, we calculate the fee for the third year. Again, we add $10 to the fee from the second year:\n- Year 3 fee = Year 2 fee + $10 = $90 + $10 = $100.\n\nNow, we move on to the fourth year. We continue the pattern of adding $10:\n- Year 4 fee = Year 3 fee + $10 = $100 + $10 = $110.\n\nFor the fifth year, we again add $10 to the fee from the fourth year:\n- Year 5 fee = Year 4 fee + $10 = $110 + $10 = $120.\n\nFinally, we calculate the fee for the sixth year by adding $10 to the fee from the fifth year:\n- Year 6 fee = Year 5 fee + $10 = $120 + $10 = $130.\n\nThus, the membership cost in the sixth year is $130.",

    "final_answer": "3982",
    "cot": "To determine how much money Joseph will have in the hedge fund after two years, I will break down the calculations year by year.\n\nFirst, let's look at the initial investment. Joseph starts with $1000. Additionally, he deposits $100 every month. Over the course of one year, he will make 12 monthly deposits, which totals to $100 * 12 = $1200. Therefore, at the end of the first year, the total amount he has invested is:\n\nInitial investment + Total monthly deposits = $1000 + $1200 = $2200.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the interest earned during the first year. The fund promises a yearly interest rate of 10%. So, the interest for the first year will be:\n\nInterest = Total amount at the end of the year * Interest rate = $2200 * 10% = $220.\n\nNow, I will add this interest to the total amount invested to find out how much Joseph has at the end of the first year:\n\nTotal value after the first year = Total invested + Interest = $2200 + $220 = $2420.\n\nNow, moving on to the second year, I need to calculate the new total amount Joseph has at the beginning of the second year. He will again deposit $100 every month for another year, which adds another $1200 to his investment. Therefore, the total amount at the beginning of the second year is:\n\nTotal at the end of the first year + Total monthly deposits for the second year = $2420 + $1200 = $3620.\n\nNext, I will calculate the interest earned during the second year based on this new total. Again, using the 10% interest rate:\n\nInterest for the second year = Total amount at the beginning of the second year * Interest rate = $3620 * 10% = $362.\n\nFinally, I will add this interest to the total amount at the end of the second year to find out how much Joseph has after two years:\n\nTotal value after the second year = Total at the beginning of the second year + Interest = $3620 + $362 = $3982.\n\nThus, after two years, Joseph's investment in the hedge fund will be worth $3982.",

    "question": "The Rotary Club is holding its annual fundraising Omelet Breakfast, with tickets sold in advance. The tickets come in different price levels, for young children, older children, adults, and seniors. This year they sold 53 small children tickets, 35 older children tickets, 75 adult tickets, and 37 senior tickets. To figure out how many eggs they need to buy, the club estimates that small children can eat a half omelet, older children can eat a whole omelet, adults will eat two omelets, and seniors will eat one and a half omelets. Just to be on the safe side, they get enough eggs to make 25 extra omelets. If they use 2 eggs for each omelet, how many eggs will they need to buy?",
    "answer": "They'll need to make an estimated 0.5 * 53 = <<0.5*53=26.5>>26.5 omelets for small children.\nThey'll need to make an estimated 1 * 35 = <<1*35=35>>35 omelets for older children.\nThey'll need to make an estimated 2 * 75 = <<2*75=150>>150 omelets for the adults.\nAnd they'll need to make an estimated 1.5 * 37 = <<1.5*37=55.5>>55.5 omelets for the seniors.\nAlong with the 25 extra omelets they'll make as a buffer, they will need enough eggs for 26.5 + 35 + 150 + 55.5 + 25 = <<26.5+35+150+55.5+25=292>>292 omelets.\nSo they will need 2 * 292 = <<2*292=584>>584 eggs.\n#### 584",
    "final_answer": "584",
    "cot": "To determine how many eggs the Rotary Club needs to buy for their Omelet Breakfast, I will first calculate the number of omelets required for each age group based on the tickets sold.\n\n1. **Small Children**: They sold 53 small children tickets, and each small child is estimated to eat half an omelet. Therefore, the total number of omelets needed for small children is:\n   \\[\n   0.5 \\times 53 = 26.5 \\text{ omelets}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Older Children**: They sold 35 older children tickets, and each older child is estimated to eat one whole omelet. Thus, the total number of omelets needed for older children is:\n   \\[\n   1 \\times 35 = 35 \\text{ omelets}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Adults**: They sold 75 adult tickets, and each adult is estimated to eat two omelets. Therefore, the total number of omelets needed for adults is:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 75 = 150 \\text{ omelets}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Seniors**: They sold 37 senior tickets, and each senior is estimated to eat one and a half omelets. Thus, the total number of omelets needed for seniors is:\n   \\[\n   1.5 \\times 37 = 55.5 \\text{ omelets}\n   \\]\n\nNext, I will sum all the omelets needed for each group:\n\\[\n26.5 + 35 + 150 + 55.5 = 267 \\text{ omelets}\n\\]\n\nAdditionally, the club plans to make 25 extra omelets as a buffer. Therefore, the total number of omelets they need to prepare is:\n\\[\n267 + 25 = 292 \\text{ omelets}\n\\]\n\nSince each omelet requires 2 eggs, I will now calculate the total number of eggs needed:\n\\[\n2 \\times 292 = 584 \\text{ eggs}\n\\]\n\nThus, the Rotary Club will need to buy a total of 584 eggs for the Omelet Breakfast.",
