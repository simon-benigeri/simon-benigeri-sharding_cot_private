Joseph will make 12 monthly deposits totaling $100 * 12 = $1200
The total amount invested at the end of the first year is $1000 + $1200 = $2200
The interest for the first year is $2200 * 10% = $220
The total value after the first year is $2200 + $220 = $2420
The total amount at the beginning of the second year is $2420 + $1200 = $3620
The interest for the second year is $3620 * 10% = $362
The total value after the second year is $3620 + $362 = $3982
