Each omelet requires 2 eggs
The club plans to make 25 extra omelets as a buffer
Each senior is estimated to eat one and a half omelets
The Rotary Club sold 37 senior tickets
The total number of omelets needed for seniors is 1.5 * 37 = 55.5 omelets
Each adult is estimated to eat two omelets
The Rotary Club sold 75 adult tickets
Each older child is estimated to eat one whole omelet
The total number of omelets needed for adults is 2 * 75 = 150 omelets
The Rotary Club sold 35 older children tickets
Each small child is estimated to eat half an omelet
The Rotary Club sold 53 small children tickets
The total number of omelets needed for older children is 1 * 35 = 35 omelets
The total number of omelets needed for small children is 0.5 * 53 = 26.5 omelets
The total number of omelets needed is 26.5 + 35 + 150 + 55.5 = 267 omelets
The total number of omelets they need to prepare is 267 + 25 = 292 omelets
The total number of eggs needed is 2 * 292 = 584 eggs
