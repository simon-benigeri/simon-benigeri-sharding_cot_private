Each generation's tails are 25% longer than the previous generation
The first generation's tail length is given as 16 cm
To find 25% of the first generation's tail length, calculate 25% of 16 cm
25% of 16 cm is calculated as 0.25 * 16 cm = 4 cm
The second generation's tail length is found by adding the increase to the first generation's tail length
Second generation's tail length = 16 cm + 4 cm = 20 cm
To find how much longer the third generation's tails are, calculate 25% of the second generation's tail length
25% of 20 cm is calculated as 0.25 * 20 cm = 5 cm
The third generation's tail length is found by adding the increase to the second generation's tail length
Third generation's tail length = 20 cm + 5 cm = 25 cm
The length of the third generation's tails is 25 cm
