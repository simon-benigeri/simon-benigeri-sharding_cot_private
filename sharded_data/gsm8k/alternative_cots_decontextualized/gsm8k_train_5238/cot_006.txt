Each set earns $1.50
The family collected 20 kilograms of newspapers
For every 5 kilograms of newspapers, the family receives $1.50
To find out how many sets of 5 kilograms, divide 20 kilograms by 5
For every 12 cans recycled, the family receives $0.50
The family collected a total of 144 cans
Each set earns $0.50
20 kilograms ÷ 5 = 4 sets of 5 kilograms
To find out how many sets of 12 cans, divide 144 cans by 12
144 cans ÷ 12 = 12 sets of 12 cans
The earnings from the cans is 12 sets × $0.50 = $6
The earnings from the newspapers is 4 sets × $1.50 = $6
To find the total amount of money, add the earnings from the cans and newspapers
$6 (from cans) + $6 (from newspapers) = $12
The total amount of money the family would receive is $12
