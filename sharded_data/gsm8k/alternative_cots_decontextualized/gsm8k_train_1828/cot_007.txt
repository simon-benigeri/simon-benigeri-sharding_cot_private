The total of monthly deposits for one year is $100 * 12 = $1200

The interest for the first year is calculated as $2200 * 10% = $220
The total value of the investment at the end of the first year is $2200 + $220 = $2420

Joseph will continue to deposit $100 every month for another year, totaling $1200
The total amount invested at the beginning of the second year is $2420 + $1200 = $3620
The interest for the second year is calculated as $3620 * 10% = $362
The total value of the investment at the end of the second year is $3620 + $362 = $3982
