# Alternative COT 1
# Sequence: s1 → s2 → s3 → s4 → s5 → s8 → s9 → s6 → s7

James starts with a total of 500 Legos
James uses half of his collection to build a castle
Half of 500 is calculated as 500 / 2 = 250
James has used 250 Legos to build the castle
The number of Legos remaining after use is calculated as 500 - 250 = 250 Legos
The number of Legos James actually puts back in the box is calculated as 250 - 5 = 245 Legos
The total number of Legos in the box at the end is 245
James is instructed to put away the leftover Legos
James is missing 5 pieces
