Each jar is sold for $4
Matthew picked twice as many strawberries as Natalie
Matthew picked 20 more strawberries than Betty
Matthew's strawberries = 2 × Natalie's strawberries
Betty picked 16 strawberries
Each jar of jam requires 7 strawberries
Matthew's strawberries = Betty's strawberries + 20
Matthew's strawberries = 16 + 20 = 36 strawberries
Natalie's strawberries = 36 / 2 = 18 strawberries
Betty picked 16 strawberries, Matthew picked 36 strawberries, and Natalie picked 18 strawberries
Total strawberries = Betty's strawberries + Matthew's strawberries + Natalie's strawberries
Total strawberries = 16 + 36 + 18 = 70 strawberries
Number of jars = Total strawberries / Strawberries per jar
Number of jars = 70 / 7 = 10 jars
Total earnings = Number of jars × Price per jar
Total earnings = 10 × $4 = $40
