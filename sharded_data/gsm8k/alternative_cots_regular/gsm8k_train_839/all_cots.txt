# Alternative COT 1
# Sequence: s7 → s5 → s8 → s3 → s4 → s9 → s6 → s10 → s11 → s12 → s13 → s14

They sold 75 adult tickets, and each adult is estimated to eat two omelets
They sold 35 older children tickets, and each older child is estimated to eat one whole omelet
Therefore, the total number of omelets needed for adults is: 2 × 75 = 150 omelets
They sold 53 small children tickets, and each small child is estimated to eat half an omelet
Therefore, the total number of omelets needed for small children is: 0.5 × 53 = 26.5 omelets
They sold 37 senior tickets, and each senior is estimated to eat one and a half omelets
Thus, the total number of omelets needed for older children is: 1 × 35 = 35 omelets
Thus, the total number of omelets needed for seniors is: 1.5 × 37 = 55.5 omelets
Next, I will sum all the omelets needed for each group: 26.5 + 35 + 150 + 55.5 = 267 omelets
Additionally, the club plans to make 25 extra omelets as a buffer
Therefore, the total number of omelets they need to prepare is: 267 + 25 = 292 omelets
Since each omelet requires 2 eggs, I will now calculate the total number of eggs needed: 2 × 292 = 584 eggs
