# Alternative COT 1
# Sequence: s5 → s1 → s2 → s3 → s4 → s6 → s7

Initially, Ines had $20 in her purse
The problem states that peaches cost $2 per pound and that Ines bought 3 pounds
So, I calculate the total cost of the peaches by multiplying the number of pounds by the cost per pound
3 pounds * $2 per pound = $6
Now that I know Ines spent $6 on the peaches, I can find out how much money she has left
To find the remaining amount, I subtract the cost of the peaches from her initial amount
$20 - $6 = $14

# Alternative COT 2
# Sequence: s1 → s2 → s3 → s4 → s5 → s6 → s7

The problem states that peaches cost $2 per pound and that Ines bought 3 pounds
So, I calculate the total cost of the peaches by multiplying the number of pounds by the cost per pound
3 pounds * $2 per pound = $6
Now that I know Ines spent $6 on the peaches, I can find out how much money she has left
Initially, Ines had $20 in her purse
To find the remaining amount, I subtract the cost of the peaches from her initial amount
$20 - $6 = $14
