The family collected a total of 144 cans.
The family collected 20 kilograms of newspapers.
The problem states that for every 5 kilograms of newspapers, they receive $1.50.
According to the problem, for every 12 cans recycled, they receive $0.50.
144 ÷ 12 = 12 sets of 12 cans.
20 ÷ 5 = 4 sets of 5 kilograms.
4 sets × $1.50 = $6.
12 sets × $0.50 = $6.
$6 (from cans) + $6 (from newspapers) = $12.
