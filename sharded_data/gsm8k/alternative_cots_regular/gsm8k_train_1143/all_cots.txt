# Alternative COT 1
# Sequence: s6 → s9 → s1 → s4 → s12 → s16

The price of each hat is $10, and she bought 3 hats
Cost for hats = 3 × $10 = $30
The price of each wooden toy is $20, and she bought 2 of them
Cost for wooden toys = 2 × $20 = $40
Total cost = $40 + $30 = $70
Change received = $100 - $70 = $30

------------------------------------------------------------

# Alternative COT 2
# Sequence: s6 → s1 → s4 → s9 → s12 → s16

The price of each hat is $10, and she bought 3 hats
The price of each wooden toy is $20, and she bought 2 of them
Cost for wooden toys = 2 × $20 = $40
Cost for hats = 3 × $10 = $30
Total cost = $40 + $30 = $70
Change received = $100 - $70 = $30

# Alternative COT 3
# Sequence: s6 → s1 → s9 → s4 → s12 → s16

The price of each hat is $10, and she bought 3 hats
The price of each wooden toy is $20, and she bought 2 of them
Cost for hats = 3 × $10 = $30
Cost for wooden toys = 2 × $20 = $40
Total cost = $40 + $30 = $70
Change received = $100 - $70 = $30

# Alternative COT 4
# Sequence: s1 → s4 → s6 → s9 → s12 → s16

The price of each wooden toy is $20, and she bought 2 of them
Cost for wooden toys = 2 × $20 = $40
The price of each hat is $10, and she bought 3 hats
Cost for hats = 3 × $10 = $30
Total cost = $40 + $30 = $70
Change received = $100 - $70 = $30
