First, we know that Betty picked 16 strawberries
The problem states that Matthew picked 20 more strawberries than Betty
Since Betty picked 16 strawberries, we can calculate Matthew's total as follows
Matthew's strawberries = Betty's strawberries + 20 = 16 + 20 = 36 strawberries
The problem indicates that Matthew picked twice as many strawberries as Natalie
Since we have already calculated that Matthew picked 36 strawberries, we can find Natalie's total by dividing Matthew's strawberries by 2
Natalie's strawberries = Matthew's strawberries / 2 = 36 / 2 = 18 strawberries
We add the strawberries picked by Betty, Matthew, and Natalie
Total strawberries = Betty's strawberries + Matthew's strawberries + Natalie's strawberries = 16 + 36 + 18 = 70 strawberries
Each jar of jam requires 7 strawberries
To find out how many jars they can make, we divide the total number of strawberries by the number of strawberries needed for one jar
Number of jars = Total strawberries / Strawberries per jar = 70 / 7 = 10 jars
The problem states that each jar is sold for $4
Therefore, we can find the total earnings by multiplying the number of jars by the price per jar
Total earnings = Number of jars × Price per jar = 10 × $4 = $40
