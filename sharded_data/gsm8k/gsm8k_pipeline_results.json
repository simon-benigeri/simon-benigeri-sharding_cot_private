    "question": "For every 12 cans you recycle, you receive $0.50, and for every 5 kilograms of newspapers, you receive $1.50. If your family collected 144 cans and 20 kilograms of newspapers, how much money would you receive?",
    "answer": "There are 144/12 = <<144/12=12>>12 sets of 12 cans that the family collected.\nSo, the family would receive $0.50 x 12 = $<<0.50*12=6>>6 for the cans.\nThere are 20/5 = <<20/5=4>>4 sets of 5 kilograms of newspapers that the family collected.\nSo, the family would receive $1.50 x 4 = $<<1.50*4=6>>6 for the newspapers.\nTherefore, the family would receive a total of $6 + $6 = $<<6+6=12>>12.\n#### 12",
    "final_answer": "12",
    "cot": "To solve the problem, I need to calculate how much money the family will receive from recycling both cans and newspapers.\n\nFirst, let's start with the cans. The problem states that for every 12 cans recycled, the family receives $0.50. The family collected a total of 144 cans. To find out how many sets of 12 cans they have, I divide the total number of cans by 12:\n\n144 cans ÷ 12 cans/set = 12 sets of 12 cans.\n\nNow that I know they have 12 sets of cans, I can calculate how much money they will receive for these cans. Since each set earns them $0.50, I multiply the number of sets by the amount earned per set:\n\n12 sets × $0.50/set = $6.\n\nNext, I will calculate the earnings from the newspapers. The problem states that for every 5 kilograms of newspapers, the family receives $1.50. They collected 20 kilograms of newspapers, so I need to find out how many sets of 5 kilograms they have:\n\n20 kilograms ÷ 5 kilograms/set = 4 sets of 5 kilograms.\n\nNow, I can calculate how much money they will receive for the newspapers. Since each set earns them $1.50, I multiply the number of sets by the amount earned per set:\n\n4 sets × $1.50/set = $6.\n\nFinally, to find the total amount of money the family will receive, I add the earnings from the cans and the newspapers together:\n\n$6 (from cans) + $6 (from newspapers) = $12.\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money the family would receive is $12.",

    "question": "Betty picked 16 strawberries. Matthew picked 20 more strawberries than Betty and twice as many as Natalie. They used their strawberries to make jam. One jar of jam used 7 strawberries and they sold each jar at $4. How much money were they able to make from the strawberries they picked?",
    "answer": "Matthew picked 16 + 20 = <<16+20=36>>36 strawberries.\nNatalie picked 36/2 = <<36/2=18>>18 strawberries.\nAll together, they have 16 + 36 + 18 = <<16+36+18=70>>70 strawberries.\nThey can make 70/7 = <<70/7=10>>10 jars of strawberries.\nThey earn 10 x $4 = $<<10*4=40>>40 from the strawberries they picked.\n#### 40",
    "final_answer": "40",
    "cot": "To solve the problem, we start by determining how many strawberries each person picked, beginning with Betty. The problem states that Betty picked 16 strawberries.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many strawberries Matthew picked. According to the problem, Matthew picked 20 more strawberries than Betty. Since Betty picked 16 strawberries, we can calculate Matthew's total as follows:\nMatthew's strawberries = Betty's strawberries + 20 = 16 + 20 = 36 strawberries.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many strawberries Natalie picked. The problem indicates that Matthew picked twice as many strawberries as Natalie. Since we have already established that Matthew picked 36 strawberries, we can find Natalie's total by dividing Matthew's strawberries by 2:\nNatalie's strawberries = Matthew's strawberries / 2 = 36 / 2 = 18 strawberries.\n\nNow that we have the number of strawberries each person picked, we can calculate the total number of strawberries they all picked together. We add the strawberries picked by Betty, Matthew, and Natalie:\nTotal strawberries = Betty's strawberries + Matthew's strawberries + Natalie's strawberries = 16 + 36 + 18 = 70 strawberries.\n\nNext, we need to determine how many jars of jam they can make with the total strawberries they have. Each jar of jam requires 7 strawberries. To find out how many jars they can make, we divide the total number of strawberries by the number of strawberries needed for one jar:\nNumber of jars = Total strawberries / Strawberries per jar = 70 / 7 = 10 jars.\n\nFinally, we need to calculate how much money they earned from selling the jars of jam. The problem states that each jar is sold for $4. Therefore, we can find the total earnings by multiplying the number of jars by the price per jar:\nTotal earnings = Number of jars × Price per jar = 10 × $4 = $40.\n\nThus, the final answer is that they were able to make $40 from the strawberries they picked.",

    "question": "Jack has a stack of books that is 12 inches thick. He knows from experience that 80 pages is one inch thick. If he has 6 books, how many pages is each one on average?",
    "answer": "There are 960 pages because 80 x 12 = <<80*12=960>>960\nEach book is 160 pages because 960 / 6 = <<960/6=160>>160\n#### 160",
    "final_answer": "160",
    "cot": "To solve the problem, I first need to determine the total number of pages in Jack's stack of books. The problem states that the stack is 12 inches thick and that 80 pages equal one inch. To find the total number of pages, I can multiply the thickness of the stack by the number of pages per inch.\n\nSo, I calculate:\n80 pages/inch × 12 inches = 960 pages.\n\nNow that I know there are a total of 960 pages in the stack, I need to find out how many pages are in each book on average. The problem tells me that Jack has 6 books. To find the average number of pages per book, I divide the total number of pages by the number of books.\n\nThus, I calculate:\n960 pages ÷ 6 books = 160 pages/book.\n\nThis means that, on average, each book contains 160 pages. Therefore, the final answer is 160.",
