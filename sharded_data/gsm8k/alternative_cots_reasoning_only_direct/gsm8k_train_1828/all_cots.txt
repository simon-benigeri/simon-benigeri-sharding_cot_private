Joseph will have invested $1000 + ($100 * 12) = 2200 after the first year
The interest calculated for the first year will be $2200 * 10% = 220
The total value of the investment for the first year will be $2200 + $220 = 2420
The total invested for the second year will be $2420 + ($100 * 12) = 3620
The interest calculated after the second year will be $3620 * 10% = 362
Joseph's investment in the mutual fund will be worth $3620 + $362 = 3982
