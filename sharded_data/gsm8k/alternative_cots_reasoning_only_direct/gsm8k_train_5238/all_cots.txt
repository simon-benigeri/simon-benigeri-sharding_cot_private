# Alternative COT 1
# Sequence: s3 → s4 → s1 → s2 → s5

The family collected 20 kilograms of newspapers, resulting in 20/5 = 4 sets of 5 kilograms
The family would receive $1.50 x 4 = $6 for the newspapers
The family collected 144 cans, resulting in 144/12 = 12 sets of 12 cans
The family would receive $0.50 x 12 = $6 for the cans
The total amount received by the family is $6 + $6 = $12
