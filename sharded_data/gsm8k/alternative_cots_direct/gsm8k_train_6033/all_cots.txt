Calculate the increase in length for the second generation's tails: 25% * 16 cm = 4 cm
Calculate the second generation's tail length by adding the increase to the first generation's tail length: 4 cm + 16 cm = 20 cm
Calculate the increase in length for the third generation's tails: 25% * 20 cm = 5 cm
Calculate the third generation's tail length by adding the increase to the second generation's tail length: 5 cm + 20 cm = 25 cm
