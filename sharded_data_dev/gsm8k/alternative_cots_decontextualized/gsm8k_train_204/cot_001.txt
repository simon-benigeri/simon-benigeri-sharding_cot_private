80 pages correspond to one inch of thickness
The stack of books is 12 inches thick
To find the total number of pages, multiply the number of pages per inch by the total thickness in inches
Calculate 80 pages/inch × 12 inches = 960 pages
There are 960 pages in total
To find the number of pages in each of the 6 books on average, divide the total number of pages by the number of books
Calculate 960 pages ÷ 6 books = 160 pages/book
On average, each book contains 160 pages
