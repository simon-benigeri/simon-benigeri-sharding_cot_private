Joseph invested $1000 into a hedge fund
The fund promised a yearly interest rate of 10%
Joseph deposits $100 every month into the account
Over the course of a year, Joseph will make 12 monthly deposits
The total of monthly deposits for one year is $100 * 12 = $1200
At the end of the first year, the total amount invested is $1000 + $1200 = $2200
The interest for the first year is calculated as $2200 * 10% = $220
The total value of the investment at the end of the first year is $2200 + $220 = $2420
At the beginning of the second year, Joseph's investment is worth $2420
Joseph will continue to deposit $100 every month for another year, totaling $1200
The total amount invested at the beginning of the second year is $2420 + $1200 = $3620
The interest for the second year is calculated as $3620 * 10% = $362
The total value of the investment at the end of the second year is $3620 + $362 = $3982
