I start with the total number of Legos that James has, which is 500
The problem states that James uses half of his Legos to build a castle
To find out how many Legos he used, I calculate half of 500: 500 / 2 = 250
This means James used 250 Legos for his castle
Since he started with 500 Legos and used 250, the number of Legos that remain unused is also 250
According to the problem, James puts all of the leftover pieces back in the box, but he can't find 5 pieces
To find out how many Legos he actually puts back in the box, I subtract the 5 missing pieces from the 250 leftover Legos: 250 - 5 = 245
Thus, the total number of Legos that are in the box at the end is 245
