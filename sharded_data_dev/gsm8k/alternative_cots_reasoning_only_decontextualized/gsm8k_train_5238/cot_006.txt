The family collected 144 cans, and 144 ÷ 12 = 12 sets of 12 cans
The family collected 20 kilograms of newspapers, and 20 ÷ 5 = 4 sets of 5 kilograms
The family receives $0.50 for each set of 12 cans, so 12 sets × $0.50 = $6
The family receives $1.50 for each set of 5 kilograms, so 4 sets × $1.50 = $6
The total amount of money is $6 (from cans) + $6 (from newspapers) = $12
