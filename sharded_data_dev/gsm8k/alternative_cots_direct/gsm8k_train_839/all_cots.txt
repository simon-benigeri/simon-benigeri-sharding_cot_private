# Alternative COT 1
# Sequence: s1 → s3 → s4 → s2 → s5 → s6

An estimated 0.5 * 53 = 26.5 omelets are needed for small children
An estimated 2 * 75 = 150 omelets are needed for adults
An estimated 1.5 * 37 = 55.5 omelets are needed for seniors
An estimated 1 * 35 = 35 omelets are needed for older children
The total number of omelets needed is 26.5 + 35 + 150 + 55.5 + 25 = 292
The total number of eggs needed is 2 * 292 = 584
