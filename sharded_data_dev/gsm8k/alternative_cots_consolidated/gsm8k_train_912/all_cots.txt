First, we know that Betty picked 16 strawberries.
Next, we need to determine how many strawberries Matthew picked. The problem states that Matthew picked 20 more strawberries than Betty. Since Betty picked 16 strawberries, we can calculate Matthew's total as follows: Matthew's strawberries = Betty's strawberries + 20 Matthew's strawberries = 16 + 20 = 36 strawberries.
Now that we know how many strawberries Matthew picked, we need to find out how many strawberries Natalie picked. The problem indicates that Matthew picked twice as many strawberries as Natalie. Therefore, we can express Natalie's strawberries in terms of Matthew's: Matthew's strawberries = 2 × Natalie's strawberries To find Natalie's strawberries, we rearrange the equation: Natalie's strawberries = Matthew's strawberries / 2 Natalie's strawberries = 36 / 2 = 18 strawberries.
Next, we will calculate the total number of strawberries they picked together. We add the strawberries from all three: Total strawberries = Betty's strawberries + Matthew's strawberries + Natalie's strawberries Total strawberries = 16 + 36 + 18 = 70 strawberries.
Now that we know the total number of strawberries, we can determine how many jars of jam they can make. Each jar of jam requires 7 strawberries. To find the number of jars, we divide the total number of strawberries by the number of strawberries needed for one jar: Number of jars = Total strawberries / Strawberries per jar Number of jars = 70 / 7 = 10 jars.
Finally, we need to calculate how much money they made from selling the jars of jam. Each jar is sold for $4. Therefore, we multiply the number of jars by the price per jar: Total earnings = Number of jars × Price per jar Total earnings = 10 × $4 = $40.
