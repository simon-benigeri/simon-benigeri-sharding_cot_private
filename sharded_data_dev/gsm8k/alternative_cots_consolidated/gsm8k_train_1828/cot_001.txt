Joseph starts with an initial investment of $1000. Additionally, he deposits $100 every month. Over the course of one year, he will make 12 monthly deposits. Therefore, the total amount he invests in the first year is calculated as follows: Initial investment: $1000 Monthly contributions for one year: $100 * 12 = $1200 Total investment after one year: $1000 + $1200 = $2200
Next, we need to calculate the interest earned on this total investment after the first year. The fund offers a yearly interest rate of 10%. So, the interest for the first year can be calculated as: Interest for the first year: $2200 * 10% = $220
Now, we add this interest to the total investment to find out how much Joseph has at the end of the first year: Total value after the first year: $2200 + $220 = $2420
Moving on to the second year, we need to consider the new total investment, which includes the amount from the end of the first year plus the new monthly contributions. The calculation for the second year is as follows: Total investment at the start of the second year: $2420 Monthly contributions for the second year: $100 * 12 = $1200 Total investment after the second year: $2420 + $1200 = $3620
Next, we calculate the interest earned during the second year based on this new total investment: Interest for the second year: $3620 * 10% = $362
Finally, we add this interest to the total investment at the end of the second year to find out how much Joseph has in the fund after two years: Total value after the second year: $3620 + $362 = $3982
