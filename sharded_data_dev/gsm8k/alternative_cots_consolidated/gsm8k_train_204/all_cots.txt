The problem states that the stack of books is 12 inches thick, and I know that 80 pages are equivalent to 1 inch in thickness.
To find the total number of pages, I can multiply the thickness of the stack by the number of pages per inch. So, I calculate: 80 pages/inch × 12 inches = 960 pages.
Now that I know there are 960 pages in total, I need to find out how many pages are in each of the 6 books on average.
To do this, I will divide the total number of pages by the number of books: 960 pages ÷ 6 books = 160 pages/book.
Thus, on average, each book contains 160 pages.
