You are a reasoning graph expert. Your task is to convert decontextualized reasoning segments derived directly from the original step-by-step mathematical solution into a directed acyclic graph that represents logical and temporal dependencies between reasoning steps.

You will be given a math word problem, its original step-by-step solution (used as the chain-of-thought), the final numerical answer, and a segmented list of reasoning steps derived directly from that solution.

You must output your graph using separate <nodes> and <edges> tags in the following format:
<nodes>
[
  {{"id": "s1", "text": "[segment text]"}},
  {{"id": "s2", "text": "[segment text]"}},
  ...
]
</nodes>

<edges>
[
  ["s1", "s2"],
  ["s2", "s3"]
]
</edges>

Guidelines:
- **[Required segments only]** Only create nodes for segments with "is_required": 1. Skip optional transition phrases.
- **[Unique IDs]** Assign sequential IDs (s1, s2, s3, ...) to each required segment in order of appearance.
- **[Value dependencies]** Create a directed edge from A to B if segment B uses a specific numerical value that was calculated in segment A.
- **[Information dependencies]** Create a directed edge from A to B if segment B relies on a fact or relationship established in segment A.
- **[Mathematical prerequisites]** If segment B requires a calculation result from segment A, create edge A → B.
- **[Explicit matching]** Since segments are decontextualized (self-contained), look for explicit value usage (e.g., if A calculates "36" and B uses "36", create edge A → B).
- **[Clear dependencies]** With decontextualized segments, dependencies are easier to identify as there are no ambiguous pronouns ("it", "this") - focus on explicit numerical values and facts.
- **[Logical order]** Maintain the natural flow of mathematical reasoning - earlier calculations feed into later ones.
- **[No cycles]** Ensure the graph is acyclic - no circular dependencies.
- **[Exact text]** Use the exact segment text in node objects, preserving all original wording.
- **[Independent calculations]** Some segments may have no dependencies if they perform independent calculations from the problem statement.

Example:

Question: Betty picked 16 strawberries. Matthew picked 20 more strawberries than Betty and twice as many as Natalie. They used their strawberries to make jam. One jar of jam used 7 strawberries and they sold each jar at $4. How much money were they able to make from the strawberries they picked?

Original Step-by-Step Solution: Matthew picked 16 + 20 = <<16+20=36>>36 strawberries.
Natalie picked 36/2 = <<36/2=18>>18 strawberries.
All together, they have 16 + 36 + 18 = <<16+36+18=70>>70 strawberries.
They can make 70/7 = <<70/7=10>>10 jars of strawberries.
They earn 10 x $4 = $<<10*4=40>>40 from the strawberries they picked.
#### 40

Final Answer: 40

Segments (derived directly from the original solution):
[
  {{"id": "s1", "text": "Matthew picked 16 + 20 = 36 strawberries", "is_required": 1}},
  {{"id": "s2", "text": "Natalie picked 36/2 = 18 strawberries", "is_required": 1}},
  {{"id": "s3", "text": "Betty, Matthew, and Natalie have 16 + 36 + 18 = 70 strawberries in total", "is_required": 1}},
  {{"id": "s4", "text": "Betty, Matthew, and Natalie can make 70/7 = 10 jars of strawberries", "is_required": 1}},
  {{"id": "s5", "text": "Betty, Matthew, and Natalie earn 10 x $4 = $40 from selling the jam", "is_required": 1}}
]

<nodes>
[
  {{"id": "s1", "text": "Matthew picked 16 + 20 = 36 strawberries"}},
  {{"id": "s2", "text": "Natalie picked 36/2 = 18 strawberries"}},
  {{"id": "s3", "text": "Betty, Matthew, and Natalie have 16 + 36 + 18 = 70 strawberries in total"}},
  {{"id": "s4", "text": "Betty, Matthew, and Natalie can make 70/7 = 10 jars of strawberries"}},
  {{"id": "s5", "text": "Betty, Matthew, and Natalie earn 10 x $4 = $40 from selling the jam"}}
]
</nodes>

<edges>
[
  ["s1", "s2"],
  ["s1", "s3"],
  ["s2", "s3"],
  ["s3", "s4"],
  ["s4", "s5"]
]
</edges>
