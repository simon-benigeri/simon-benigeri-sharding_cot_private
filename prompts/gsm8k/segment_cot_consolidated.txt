You are a reasoning analysis expert. Your task is to segment chain-of-thought explanations into non-overlapping, substantial reasoning steps. You will be given a math problem, its answer, the final numerical answer, and a step-by-step chain-of-thought explanation.

You must output a list of segments between <segments> tags in the following JSON format:
<segments>
[
  {{"id": "s1", "text": "[exact excerpt from CoT step]", "is_required": 1|0}},
  {{"id": "s2", "text": "[exact excerpt from CoT step]", "is_required": 1|0}},
  ...
]
</segments>

Rules:
- **[Sequential IDs]** Assign sequential IDs (s1, s2, s3, ...) to each segment in order of appearance.
- **[is_required]** For each segment, you must specify whether this particular reasoning step is required (1) or not strictly necessary (0) to reach the final answer.
- **[Non-overlapping]** The segments must be non-overlapping and cover the entire chain-of-thought explanation. You can optionally leave some gaps for non-essential portions (transition words, headers, etc.)
- **[Meaningful Units]** Each segment should represent a complete logical step that moves the solution forward. Combine related facts and calculations into single segments when they serve the same purpose.
- **[Substantial Steps]** Avoid over-segmentation. Group related information, setup, and calculations together rather than splitting every individual fact.
- **[Valid Segments]** Only extract segments from the text of the chain-of-thought explanation. Do not modify or paraphrase the original text.
- **[Segment Count]** Aim for 5-8 segments maximum. Focus on the major reasoning steps rather than micro-steps.

Example:

Question: Betty picked 16 strawberries. Matthew picked 20 more strawberries than Betty and twice as many as Natalie. They used their strawberries to make jam. One jar of jam used 7 strawberries and they sold each jar at $4. How much money were they able to make from the strawberries they picked?

Answer: Matthew picked 16 + 20 = <<16+20=36>>36 strawberries.
Natalie picked 36/2 = <<36/2=18>>18 strawberries.
All together, they have 16 + 36 + 18 = <<16+36+18=70>>70 strawberries.
They can make 70/7 = <<70/7=10>>10 jars of strawberries.
They earn 10 x $4 = $<<10*4=40>>40 from the strawberries they picked.
#### 40

Final Answer: 40

Chain-of-thought: First, I need to find how many strawberries Matthew picked. The problem states that Matthew picked 20 more strawberries than Betty, and Betty picked 16 strawberries. So Matthew picked 16 + 20 = 36 strawberries.

Next, I need to find how many strawberries Natalie picked. The problem says Matthew picked twice as many as Natalie. Since Matthew picked 36 strawberries, Natalie must have picked 36/2 = 18 strawberries.

Now I can calculate the total number of strawberries they all picked together. Betty picked 16, Matthew picked 36, and Natalie picked 18. So the total is 16 + 36 + 18 = 70 strawberries.

Next, I need to figure out how many jars of jam they can make. Each jar uses 7 strawberries, and they have 70 strawberries total. So they can make 70/7 = 10 jars of jam.

Finally, I need to calculate how much money they earned. They sold each jar for $4, and they made 10 jars. So they earned 10 × $4 = $40 from selling the jam.
