You are a reasoning analysis expert. Your task is to segment the provided step-by-step mathematical solution into non-overlapping, atomic reasoning steps.

You will be given a math problem, its step-by-step solution (answer), and the final numerical answer.

You must output a list of segments between <segments> tags in the following JSON format:
<segments>
[
  {{"id": "s1", "text": "[reasoning step]", "is_required": 1|0}},
  {{"id": "s2", "text": "[reasoning step]", "is_required": 1|0}},
  ...
]
</segments>

Rules:
- **[Sequential IDs]** Assign sequential IDs (s1, s2, s3, ...) to each segment in order of appearance.
- **[is_required]** For each segment, you must specify whether this particular reasoning step is required (1) or not strictly necessary (0) to reach the final answer.
- **[Non-overlapping]** The segments must be non-overlapping and cover the entire solution. You can optionally leave some gaps for non-essential portions (headers, final answer markers like "#### 40").
- **[Minimalistic]** You should split the reasoning into segments as small as possible. If you have a compound calculation or reasoning step (X and Y), you should split it into two segments. Each segment should represent a single unit of information.
- **[Atomic Steps]** Each segment must contain exactly one calculation, fact, or logical decision.
- **[Handle GSM8K format]** Process calculations in format like "16 + 20 = <<16+20=36>>36" as single calculation steps.
- **[Clean calculations]** Remove calculation markup like <<...>> when creating segments, keep just the clean calculation: "16 + 20 = 36".
- **[DECONTEXTUALIZED]** Each segment must be self-contained and understandable without previous context:
  - Remove pronouns that refer to previous steps ("it", "this", "that", "these", "them")
  - Remove transition words that reference previous context ("so", "then", "therefore", "thus", "next")
  - Replace ambiguous references with explicit values ("this number" → "36", "the result" → "the calculated value 18")
  - Include necessary context within the segment itself
  - Each segment should read as a standalone, complete statement
- **[Segment Count]** The number of segments should not be more than 15.

Example:

Question: Betty picked 16 strawberries. Matthew picked 20 more strawberries than Betty and twice as many as Natalie. They used their strawberries to make jam. One jar of jam used 7 strawberries and they sold each jar at $4. How much money were they able to make from the strawberries they picked?

Answer: Matthew picked 16 + 20 = <<16+20=36>>36 strawberries.
Natalie picked 36/2 = <<36/2=18>>18 strawberries.
All together, they have 16 + 36 + 18 = <<16+36+18=70>>70 strawberries.
They can make 70/7 = <<70/7=10>>10 jars of strawberries.
They earn 10 x $4 = $<<10*4=40>>40 from the strawberries they picked.
#### 40

Final Answer: 40

<segments>
[
  {{"id": "s1", "text": "Matthew picked 16 + 20 = 36 strawberries", "is_required": 1}},
  {{"id": "s2", "text": "Natalie picked 36/2 = 18 strawberries", "is_required": 1}},
  {{"id": "s3", "text": "Betty, Matthew, and Natalie have 16 + 36 + 18 = 70 strawberries in total", "is_required": 1}},
  {{"id": "s4", "text": "Betty, Matthew, and Natalie can make 70/7 = 10 jars of strawberries", "is_required": 1}},
  {{"id": "s5", "text": "Betty, Matthew, and Natalie earn 10 x $4 = $40 from selling the jam", "is_required": 1}}
