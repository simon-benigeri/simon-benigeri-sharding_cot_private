You are a reasoning graph expert. Your task is to convert decontextualized reasoning segments into a directed acyclic graph that represents logical and temporal dependencies between reasoning steps. Since the segments are decontextualized (self-contained), you need to identify dependencies based on explicit value usage and logical prerequisites.

You will be given a math word problem, its answer, the final numerical answer, a chain-of-thought explanation, and a segmented list of decontextualized reasoning steps.

You must output your graph using separate <nodes> and <edges> tags in the following format:
<nodes>
[
  {{"id": "s1", "text": "[segment text]"}},
  {{"id": "s2", "text": "[segment text]"}},
  ...
]
</nodes>

<edges>
[
  ["s1", "s2"],
  ["s2", "s3"]
]
</edges>

Guidelines:
- **[Required segments only]** Only create nodes for segments with "is_required": 1. Skip optional transition phrases.
- **[Unique IDs]** Assign sequential IDs (s1, s2, s3, ...) to each required segment in order of appearance.
- **[Value dependencies]** Create a directed edge from A to B if segment B uses a specific numerical value that was calculated in segment A.
- **[Information dependencies]** Create a directed edge from A to B if segment B relies on a fact or relationship established in segment A.
- **[Explicit matching]** Since segments are decontextualized, look for explicit value usage (e.g., if A calculates "36" and B uses "36", create edge A → B).
- **[Logical prerequisites]** If segment B requires knowing something established in segment A to make sense, create edge A → B.
- **[No cycles]** Ensure the graph is acyclic - no circular dependencies.
- **[Exact text]** Use the exact segment text in node objects, preserving all original wording.
- **[Independent segments]** Some segments may have no dependencies if they establish independent facts from the problem statement.

Example:

Question: Betty picked 16 strawberries. Matthew picked 20 more strawberries than Betty and twice as many as Natalie. They used their strawberries to make jam. One jar of jam used 7 strawberries and they sold each jar at $4. How much money were they able to make from the strawberries they picked?

Answer: Matthew picked 16 + 20 = <<16+20=36>>36 strawberries.
Natalie picked 36/2 = <<36/2=18>>18 strawberries.
All together, they have 16 + 36 + 18 = <<16+36+18=70>>70 strawberries.
They can make 70/7 = <<70/7=10>>10 jars of strawberries.
They earn 10 x $4 = $<<10*4=40>>40 from the strawberries they picked.
#### 40

Final Answer: 40

Chain-of-thought: First, I need to find how many strawberries Matthew picked. The problem states that Matthew picked 20 more strawberries than Betty, and Betty picked 16 strawberries. So Matthew picked 16 + 20 = 36 strawberries.

Next, I need to find how many strawberries Natalie picked. The problem says Matthew picked twice as many as Natalie. Since Matthew picked 36 strawberries, Natalie must have picked 36/2 = 18 strawberries.

Now I can calculate the total number of strawberries they all picked together. Betty picked 16, Matthew picked 36, and Natalie picked 18. So the total is 16 + 36 + 18 = 70 strawberries.

Next, I need to figure out how many jars of jam they can make. Each jar uses 7 strawberries, and they have 70 strawberries total. So they can make 70/7 = 10 jars of jam.

Finally, I need to calculate how much money they earned. They sold each jar for $4, and they made 10 jars. So they earned 10 × $4 = $40 from selling the jam.
